Plant Mega Pack 1.10.2 port.

WARNING: This port contains at least one world-breaking bug. Do NOT use without backing up your worlds first. I know every mod says this, but this warning is for real. Aquatic plants = death.

After 10pak's abrupt retirement from modding, it looked like PMP's development wasn't going to be continued. Since I considered the mod an essential, I decided I'd go ahead and update it to Minecraft 1.10.2. After decompiling the mod and fixing up the source, I made this repo for anyone else who wanted to contribute to its development. Nowadays I don't have a lot of time for mod-making, so it's really up to the community to keep this thing going. I just wanted to do my part in keeping a mod I greatly enjoyed alive.
