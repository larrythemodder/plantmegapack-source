Plant Mega Pack 1.10.2 port.

WARNING: This port is incomplete and contains several known bugs, including at least one world-breaking. DO NOT use this on your main game.

After 10pak's abrupt retirement from modding, it looked like PMP's development wasn't going to be continued. Since I considered the mod an essential, I decided I'd go ahead and update it to Minecraft 1.10.2. After decompiling the mod and fixing up the source, I made this repo for anyone else who wanted to contribute to its development. Nowadays I don't have time for mod-making, so it's really up to the community to keep this thing going. I just wanted to do my part in keeping a mod I greatly enjoyed alive.

# New Releases
Currently, the only compiled version available is 1.10.2-PORT1. The next release will be 1.10.2.2. There is no set release date, but it should be available once two major bugs get fixed (epiphytes and placing aquatic plants). This release won't look much different from the previous, but JEI will be a lot easier to use due to internal code changes.
